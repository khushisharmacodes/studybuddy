## 🧸 Teddy Companion

A cute teddy bear (not a bunny!) with sparkles, a bow tie, and toe beans. Teddy reacts to your real activity:
- Celebrates when you hit your daily focus goal
- Gets excited when you are consistently productive
- Motivates you when you have weak subjects or missed goals
- Worries near upcoming exams
- Misses you after inactivity

## 🔔 Notifications

The backend generates notifications for:
- Upcoming exams
- Streak reminders
- Pending daily goals
- Weak subject nudges
- Study reminders after inactivity

## 🛡️ Admin

Users with `role: 'admin'` can access `/admin` to:
- Create/update exams
- Create notices
- Broadcast announcements to all users
- View platform stats

## 😴 Focus Guard

On the Focus page you can enable Focus Guard. It turns on your webcam, loads lightweight face-api.js models, and monitors your eyes. If you close your eyes for too long or look away, it plays a wake-up sound and shows an alert. Video processing happens entirely in your browser.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- AI-powered adaptive study plans
- Burnout prediction
- Smart pomodoro timing
- Push notifications

- Advanced ML recommendations
