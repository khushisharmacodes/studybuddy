# StudyBuddy 🧸

**StudyBuddy** is a modern, AI-powered productivity and study companion app built for college students — but flexible enough for coders, readers, freelancers, and lifelong learners.
> Notion + Forest + Duolingo + Pinterest + Spotify focus mode — all in one cozy, aesthetic app.

## 💼 CV / Project Introduction

**StudyBuddy** is a full-stack productivity PWA I built to help students study smarter. It combines a Pomodoro focus timer, AI-powered study recommendations, goal tracking, journaling, analytics, exam monitoring, and a camera-based drowsiness detector. The app uses JWT authentication, MongoDB for data persistence, cron jobs for notifications, and a service worker for offline support and automatic updates across devices.

Built with **React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**, it demonstrates full-stack development, state management, REST API design, real-time notifications, PWA deployment, and computer-vision integration in the browser.

## 🚀 Deploy to Render (free)

One-click deploy the full app (backend + frontend + MongoDB):

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/KhushieSharma/studybuddy)

After deploy:
1. Create a free **MongoDB Atlas** cluster (or use any MongoDB URI).
2. In the Render dashboard, add an environment variable:
   - `MONGODB_URI` = your MongoDB connection string
3. Render auto-generates `JWT_SECRET`. You can leave it or set your own.
4. Once the service is live, open the Render URL on your phone and install the PWA.

## 🧸 Teddy Companion

A cute teddy bear (not a bunny!) with sparkles, a bow tie, and toe beans. Teddy reacts to your real activity:
- Celebrates when you hit your daily focus goal
- Gets excited when you are consistently productive
- Motivates you when you have weak subjects or missed goals
- Worries near upcoming exams
- Misses you after inactivity

## 🔔 Notifications

The backend generates notifications for:
- Upcoming exams
- Streak reminders
- Pending daily goals
- Weak subject nudges
- Study reminders after inactivity

## 🛡️ Admin

Users with `role: 'admin'` can access `/admin` to:
- Create/update exams
- Create notices
- Broadcast announcements to all users
- View platform stats

## 😴 Focus Guard

On the Focus page you can enable Focus Guard. It turns on your webcam, loads lightweight face-api.js models, and monitors your eyes. If you close your eyes for too long or look away, it plays a wake-up sound and shows an alert. Video processing happens entirely in your browser.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- AI-powered adaptive study plans
- Burnout prediction
- Smart pomodoro timing
- Push notifications
- GPA prediction
- Advanced ML recommendations
